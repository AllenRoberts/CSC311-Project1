ReadMe file for Postfix evaluation using a Stack in Python 3.7.

== Description ==

This program was designed to be able to evaluate an expression after it has been reoriented into postfix notation using a stack. The program first checks if a character in the string is a number and if so it pushes it onto the stack. If the the character in the string is not a number the program then checks if it is any of the four operators. Once it finds an operator in the takes the two most recent values added to the stack and calculates them by the found operator. Once the loop has finished the top value of the stack is returned which is the answer to the expression that was inputted.
